Moin!

File "main.py" is the initial Python project in which I developed the code.
File "main.ipynb" is a more beatiful version of it in JupyterNotebook with workflow explanations.

- You can find the summary of the results at the end of JupyterNotebook.
- It also contains answers to questions from assignment description.
